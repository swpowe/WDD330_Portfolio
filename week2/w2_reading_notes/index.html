            <h2>week02-notes and reading</h2>
                <p> this week has been a little chaotic, my wife is giving brith in the next room over,<br>
                    and a lot has gone down concerning that this week. so my acount and retention wasnt <br>
                    as great this time around. that being said i did get some interesting take aways.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Arrays have always been my most well understood forms of variable arguments.<br>
                         Basically they are multiple defining elements for a variable.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Continuing we have loops which are parameter that have multiple outcomes for a variable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And finally, logics, which are logical statements that, that just use logic operators <br>
                        like + or â€“ which connect multiple statements or variable together and return a true or false statement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functions I like to think as a little parameter that does some sort of specific thing, or task. These can <br>
                        then be linked to variables to act in specific ways.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        arrays, logics, and loops, seem to to make up all our functions and act as different logical systems to <br>
                        breath life into our scripts.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            In general, it seems to me that JS makes up the brain of the web page, if there is something specific needing <br>
                            to be done that is a little bit more technical, js is going to do it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to become more proficent with JS, i need to understand these systems better this will alow me to free code<br>
                            with less problems.
                        </p>
