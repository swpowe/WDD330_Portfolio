            <h2>week01-notes and reading</h2>
                <p> it felt like to me there was three main things that i learned from the reading<br>
                    and the assignment
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>stored data: things like const array, even var arrays keep a list of information<br>
                        under a certain title that become easier to call up later and use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        const tags in JS: a const tag or constant creates a object that becomes<br>
                        unchangable for the most part with a few exceptions. these constants'<br>
                        are able to act as a type of value system that can either make an array,<br>
                        or a variable of sorts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        file Pathing: honestly i had already learned this, but for some reason it<br>
                        it became so much more clear with this exercise. / enters into a file ../ <br>
                        moves out of one simple.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        i may need to use word docs for composing information, i have a lot of <br>
                        spelling errors
                    </li>
                </ol>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            My general thoughts, is that storage and proper pathing and organizing <br>
                            become incredible important in the begining development phase of a website<br>
                            doing so can actually make site officency better, running smoother and faster.<br>
                            and maybe save you a couple headaches along the way.
                        </p>
