            <h3>what i did</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        first: i created my skeleton inde.html file with proper set up, <br> 
                        adn created a template for it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        second: i added all necessary tags to the page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        third: all apropriate files were created and organized.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        fourth: i took on the main.js exercise
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        fifth: i did the reading, and began personal reading for some question<br>
                        i had
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        finally: composed my thoughts, notes and questions.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            <h3>my questions or concerns</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        my first question was how many apropriate tags are there for creating an array?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        what are the main uses for a const tag? could i not just use a "var"?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        are arrays and boolean statments the bulk of most JS scripting functions?
                    </li>
                </ol>
        </main>
