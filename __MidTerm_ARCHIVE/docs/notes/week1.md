Mobile UX
• Mobile First. Helps focus on most important features
• Then expand to larger (tablet, desktop)
• Be there for the user
    • Think about how and where they grip the device
    • Put the most needed functionality in those easiest places
• Speed Matters
    • Stats around Bing and Google load times vs drop in revenue
    • Reduce image size and usage
    • SVG, minified, optimized, etc
    • GZIP
• Menu design
    • Need to care. Empathy
    • Menu at the bottom? Easier to reach / use but not the norm
    • Better reachability == created perception of speed
    • "Always strive for amazing" not good enough
• Inputs and Forms
    • Make it simple
    • Needs to be mobile friendly
    • Only request most important and necessary info
    • Ditch the labels (display in input), make bigger, Float labels,
        • Pagination
    • Passwords! Difficult to type on mobile.
    • Not sure what they've typed (masking)
        • Maybe don't hide by default
    • Numbers vs default keyboard
    • Phone numbers as links (a href) rather than as text
        • which requires a copy paste to call..they're on their phones already!
• Advertising
    • More ads than content on some pages
    • Shouldn't be using ad units meant for desktops
    • Popups, in-between ad still used but horrible experience
    • Make ads small and simple
    • Video ads. More info on tap
    • Ad underneath
    • Stop using pop-ups and pop-overs
    • Content comes first
    • Empathy is huge! think outside the box
