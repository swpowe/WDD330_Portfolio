                <p> 
                    Probably one of the most important things to implement in language writing is validation, <br>
                    error or exception handling, this concept is centered around making sure that whenever you <br>
                    input incorrect data it will not shut down or cause the program to error out. This for <br>
                    obvious reason makes it so that when you input a 15 instead of fifteen it will handle <br>
                    this exception and give you a message instead of shutting down. There are many ways for <br>
                    you to do this, but my favorites are validation, Exceptions handling, and testing.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Validation is simple, it is when we take and write a function that will not allow <br>
                        certain information through, or will tell it is not valid, like the example explained above.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Exception handling is when we take a function and we tell it that we would like to try <br>
                        something, and if it fails then we do something else. Essentially you are making sure it <br>
                        doesn’t not stop the program mid-way through. And will allow you to see the full program <br>
                        running, even if it doesn’t work fully.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Testing is simple in nature to, to test means to write maybe a basic function that will <br>
                        make sure that certain variable or data works. For example. If I make an object array, I <br>can run a print log to make sure the info was stored correctly.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            To conclude, I think I understand the nature of this section well. In truth its more <br>
                            just learning more techniques to test your code and keep the everything running smoothly. <br>
                            So for me to excel in this section, it would be good to learn more about what kind of <br>
                            validation I could use.
