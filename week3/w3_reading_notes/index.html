            <h2>week03-notes and reading</h2>
                <p> 
                    I thought that this week reading was very interesting, the three major things <br>
                    I learned were about what objects are and how they are defined by elements, <br>
                    DOM’s document object model which are almost a type of identifier which allows <br>
                    you to pull information from the object, and finally events, which are what <br>
                    triggers the usage of the DOM and then using them in some way.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Objects are… well objects really, they are entities with labels behind them. <br>
                        an example would be with a object I have a name or title, like “dog” and then <br>
                        I have defining attributes like breed: shepherd, color: black, white, food <br>
                        preference: meat these defining “elements” allow us to call the object up and <br>
                        use these defining elements 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DOM which stands for document object model, is a type of formation that allows <br>
                        us to call up the object itself, this is done in many different ways, but <br>
                        ultimately you are trying to grab the elements inside the object and organize <br>
                        them in some way so they are ready to be used. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Events are the final trigger so to speak. Events are activation keys that will <br>
                        allow the DOM’s to be activated for example this might include some sort of <br>
                        console.log or maybe some other element that says hey I have been activated pull <br>
                        the information. Buttons are other forms of events more on the GUI spectrum, but <br>
                        it is something that will make the info inside the object do what ever was defined <br>
                        by the DOM. 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            My conclusive thoughts on these chapters is that I think when it comes right <br>
                            down to it I understand Objects and events very well. The part that seems to <br>
                            have the most complexity are the DOM’s since these seems to be the actual brain <br>
                            of the  whole thing, these are where formulas really come in, and when you <br>
                            understand the logic behind them you can really make a lot of things happen.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                i need to understand and investigate DOM's more, these models are going <br>
                                to be very importan in expanding my capabilities in JS
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                it would be worth creatiung my own object and trying a bunch of ways to <br>
                                organize them, maybe even try sometihng more, lets break how they work
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                lets start with a gaming list and do different genreas as my objects
                            </li>
                        </ol>>
