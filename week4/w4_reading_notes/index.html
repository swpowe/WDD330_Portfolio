                <p> 
                    This week, felt like an overload of information so some of the concepts are a little<br> 
                    fuzzy. It seems when dealing with objects there is a lot that can be done from them, as <br>
                    I learned last week, however when it comes to modern JavaScript, it seems that the paths <br>
                    become endless. I am of course talking about libraries, or plugins as I thought to look at them.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First are forms, forms are a type of organized data input list that can be inputted and <br>
                        stored, they allow a variety of uses and make it easy for customizing parameters for what <br>
                        kind of data can be inputted and how. An example would be a phone number were you use <br>
                        parameters such as [0-9]{3} . in this instant 0-9 mean only value with 0-9 are allowed <br>
                        and the 3 represents how many numbers. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, we have OOP or Object-oriented programing, this took me a second to understand since <br>
                        I have heard the term many times before and it became kind of a dull word with no meaning. <br>
                        Object oriented programing involves the use of objects, (feel dumb for not getting that sooner.) <br>
                        and these objects are how to accomplish your tasks, obviously there is a lot more to it. <br>
                        Suffice to say OOP is a defined way of programing where objects are the core, and once an object <br>
                        is created it can then be used to as a sort of tool for your objectives.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, is modern JS this took me awhile to understand but I think I understand a small <br>
                        part of it. Of course, the term is broad it is the use of JS in the modern programming <br>
                        environment. What I think I got confused and may need more clarity on is the libraries and how <br>
                        they are used. From what I understand is that libraries are like plugins that you can attach to <br>
                        your file that give more capabilities to the file allow more ‚Äúdefining words‚Äù that can use to code. <br>
                        I don‚Äôt think I understand the full extent of how this works but it‚Äôs something that I may need <br>
                        more experience in to understand. 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            My conclusion on these topics is that OOP is one of the most important aspects of programing, <br>
                            and that in modern JS we use extensions or plugins (libraries) to expand on how we are able <br>
                            to do things. And forms are a nice little side note on organizing data üòä 
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Ill need to explore more into the libraries, how to add them and how they are imported.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A couple test runs of forms might be fun to.
                            </li>
                        </ol>>
